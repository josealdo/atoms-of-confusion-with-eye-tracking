# Summarizing the Results for Our Research Questions (RQs)

Table 1: Results for time spent in AOI and in Code (RQ1). O = Obfuscated code; C = Clarified code; PD = percentage difference; PV = p-value; ES = effect size. Columns O and C are based on the median as a measure of central tendency.

##### Finding 1: In our study, in the clarified version of code containing the Operator Precedence, the subjects exhibit a reduction in the time spent in the AOI and in the code as a whole. However, with the clarified version of code containing Multiple Variable Assignment, there is an increase in the time in the AOI.

Table 2: Results for accuracy of the answers (RQ2). O = Obfuscated code; C = Clarified code; PD = percentage difference; PV = p-value; ES = effect size. Columns O and C are based on the median as a measure of central tendency.

Table 5: Results for the regressions count in AOI and in Code (RQ5). O = Obfuscated code; C = Clarified code; PD = percentage difference; PV = p-value; ES = effect size. Columns O and C are based on the median as a measure of central tendency.

##### Finding 5: In our study, the subjects exhibit a reduction in the regressions count in the AOI with the clarified versions of the code containing the True or False Evaluation and Operator Precedence. However, with the clarified version of code containing the Multiple Variable Assignment, there is an increase in the regressions count in the AOI.
