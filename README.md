# Seeing confusion through a new lens: On the impact of atoms on novices' code comprehension
Pablo Roberto, José Aldo, Rohit Gheyi

## Overview
Code comprehension is crucial for software maintenance and evolution processes but it can be can be hindered by small code patterns known as atoms of confusion. These atoms of confusion are tiny code snippets that can confuse developers causing them to misjudge the behavior of the code. 
Previous studies explored atoms of confusion investigating their presence in the real world setting, the developers' opinions, and controlled experiments mainly measuring time and accuracy. However, we need more empirical evidence by investigating other dimensions of analysis to better understand which atoms can affect the code comprehension and to what extent they do so.
To complement previous studies, we evaluate how six atoms affect the code comprehension of human subjects with eye tracking. 
We compare six obfuscated atoms that indicate confusion according to the literature with six respective clarified versions of the same atoms. We perform a controlled experiment with 32 novices in Python and we measure their time, accuracy, and visual effort while performing the tasks with the atoms. We measure visual effort with fixation duration, fixation count, and regressions count.
We found that the clarified versions of A3, A4, A5, and A6 reduced time and visual effort in the AOI. On the other hand, the \treatment version of A1, A2 increased time and visual effort in the AOI.
The improvements with the clarified versions of A3, A4, A5, and A6 can be associated with a better performance and code comprehension of the novices. Based on these findings, we recommend educators to give preference to these patterns in the teaching practice. In addition, practitioners and language designers should also be careful when using these patterns in the language syntax. Finally, we recommend the eye tracking methodology for the research community, which provided a more nuanced analysis of these small patterns.
